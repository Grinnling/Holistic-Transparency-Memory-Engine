Code Explanation for current Project.

Here is the detailed Mermaid flow diagram with integrated code explanations:Code Explanations:

1. ServerInitialization:

    Configures the GPU backend based on the available hardware (NVIDIA or AMD).
    Starts the system monitor thread to continuously check system resources.
    Loads the model and tokenizer, with AMD-optimized settings and fallback to manual GPU memory management.
    Starts the request processor thread to handle incoming requests.

2. SystemMonitor:

    Checks the system resources, including CPU, memory, and GPU memory utilization.
    Logs the resource utilization information.
    Clears the GPU memory if critical resource usage is detected.
    Updates the last health check timestamp.

3. EmergencyRecovery:

    Clears the GPU memory and request queue.
    Resets the model and attempts to reload it with AMD-optimized settings or fallback.
    Sets the model loaded flag based on the recovery outcome.

4. RequestProcessor:

    Dequeues requests from the request queue.
    Processes the request, including checking system resources, tokenizing the input, generating the response, and sending the response back to the client.
    Handles any errors that occur during request processing.

5. Authentication:

    Checks the authorization header in the request.
    Handles Bearer token and Basic authentication.
    Authenticates the provided credentials and returns the appropriate response.

6. HealthCheck:

    Checks the server status and returns a 'up and running' response.

7. ModelListing:

    Constructs the model data object with the necessary information.
    Returns the model list in a JSON response.

8. ChatCompletion:

    Checks if the model and tokenizer are loaded.
    Parses the request data, including extracting the messages and constructing the prompt.
    Generates the response using the loaded model.
    Sends the response back to the client in chunked format.
    Handles any errors that occur during the generation process.

The flow diagram provides a comprehensive overview of the server's functionality, including the initialization, resource monitoring, emergency recovery, request processing, authentication, and the various API endpoints. The subgraphs and their detailed explanations help to understand the logic and structure of the code, making it easier for the user to comprehend the overall system.
