# Phase 1 Implementation Checklist
## Basic Chat Continuity - Working Memory + Episodic Memory

### ðŸŽ¯ **Phase 1 Goal**
Enable "Remember what we talked about 10 minutes ago" and "Remember that conversation we had last week"

---

## ðŸ“‹ **Implementation Tasks**

### **1. MCP Memory Logger (Traffic Cop)**
- [ ] **Create MCP server skeleton**
  - [ ] Basic JSON-RPC server setup
  - [ ] Authentication/security integration with your existing framework
  - [ ] Request routing framework
  - [ ] Audit logging integration (tie into your auditd system)

- [ ] **Define memory request API**
  - [ ] `memory.store()` - store information
  - [ ] `memory.recall()` - retrieve information
  - [ ] `memory.search()` - search across memory types
  - [ ] Request/response schemas

- [ ] **Security integration**
  - [ ] Container configuration
  - [ ] Encrypted storage mount points
  - [ ] Access control policies

### **2. Working Memory Service**
- [ ] **Basic conversation buffer**
  - [ ] In-memory conversation storage (last 10-20 exchanges)
  - [ ] Simple FIFO buffer with configurable size
  - [ ] JSON format for message storage

- [ ] **API endpoints**
  - [ ] `GET /working-memory` - get current context
  - [ ] `POST /working-memory` - add new exchange
  - [ ] `DELETE /working-memory` - clear buffer
  - [ ] `PUT /working-memory/size` - adjust buffer size

- [ ] **Persistence option**
  - [ ] Redis integration (optional for restart persistence)
  - [ ] Configuration for memory-only vs. persistent modes

### **3. Episodic Memory Service**
- [ ] **Conversation episode storage**
  - [ ] SQLite database with timestamped conversations
  - [ ] Schema: conversation_id, timestamp, participants, summary, full_text
  - [ ] Basic indexing on timestamp and participants

- [ ] **API endpoints**
  - [ ] `POST /episodic-memory` - store conversation episode
  - [ ] `GET /episodic-memory/search` - search by timestamp/keywords
  - [ ] `GET /episodic-memory/recent` - get recent conversations
  - [ ] `GET /episodic-memory/{conversation_id}` - get specific conversation

- [ ] **Storage integration**
  - [ ] GoCryptFS encrypted directory for database
  - [ ] Backup/rotation policies

### **4. Memory Flow Integration**
- [ ] **Working â†’ Episodic flow**
  - [ ] Automatic episode creation when working memory reaches capacity
  - [ ] Conversation summarization for episodic storage
  - [ ] Cleanup/archival of old working memory

- [ ] **Context injection**
  - [ ] Automatic relevant memory injection into model context
  - [ ] Basic relevance scoring (keyword matching for now)
  - [ ] Context size management

### **5. Security & Testing**
- [ ] **Security implementation**
  - [ ] Verify encrypted storage is working
  - [ ] Confirm audit logs are being generated
  - [ ] Test container isolation
  - [ ] Validate authentication on memory endpoints

### **Integration Testing**
- [ ] End-to-end chat with memory retention
- [ ] Context continuity across conversation restarts
- [ ] Memory search functionality
- [ ] Performance under normal chat load

## ðŸŽ¯ **Success Criteria**
- [ ] **Chat continuity:** Can reference something from 10 minutes ago
- [ ] **Episode recall:** Can find and reference previous conversation topics
- [ ] **Secure operation:** All memory operations logged and encrypted
- [ ] **System integration:** Works seamlessly with existing TGI/middleware
- [ ] **Performance:** No noticeable latency impact on chat responses

## ðŸš€ **Next Phase Prep**
After Phase 1 is stable:
- Document API patterns for Phase 2 services
- Identify embeddings integration points
- Plan citation system architecture
- Evaluate relevance detection algorithms

**Estimated Timeline:** 1-2 weekends for core functionality, +1 weekend for security/integration polish
