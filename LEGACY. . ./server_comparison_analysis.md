## Analysis Framework

After reviewing the full code, we can create:

### **Feature Matrix**
| Feature | Original | Current | Notes |
|---------|----------|---------|-------|
| Authentication | ✅ | ✅ | Enhanced? |
| Rate Limiting | ✅ | ✅ | Improved? |
| Model Loading | ✅ | ✅ | Optimized? |
| Error Handling | ✅ | ✅ | More robust? |
| Logging | ✅ | ✅ | Better structure? |
| Container Support | ? | ✅ | New feature? |

### **Recommendation Matrix**
- **Keep from Original:** Features that work well
- **Keep from Current:** Improvements and new features  
- **Merge Opportunities:** Best of both worlds
- **Deprecate:** Features that are outdated
